## Overview
This repository collects my picoCTF writeups (solutions, notes, scripts). Each challenge is documented as a standalone Markdown file that explains the approach, steps taken, and tooling used. The goal is to have reproducible, concise, and readable writeups suitable for a technical portfolio.
